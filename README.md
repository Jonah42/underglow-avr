# DrongoGlow AVR component

This repo contains the source code for the AVR side of DrongoGlow. Beware, it's messy and not really commented. I'll clean it up if I get a moment. At the very least it's a good example of how UART works.

## Target Architecture

This is written for the AT90S8515, and as such the assembly routines are limited to the ISA available to this microcontroller. It is also designed around a 12MHz clock. To be used with WS2812B LEDs

## Building and loading

The makefile was generated by Programmers Notepad. Type `make` to build, and `make program` to load to micro. Currently set up for an AVR ISP programmer

## Other notes

There are some issues where the micro will stop responding via bluetooth, unclear at the moment whether its a microcontroller or app issue.

Note that PORTC pin 0 is used to hook up to the WS2812B LEDs.
